How can we grow deeper in wisdom and understanding, into `["post logical" thinking]({% post_url 2021-03-14-Grown-Up-Thinking %})`{=markdown}? Experience with an Agile consultant team might suggest some ways.

## Mixed Adult Population

Most people grow rapidly through `[development stages]({% post_url 2021-03-07-What-Is-Growing-Up %})`{=markdown} into adolescence and then plateau in early adulthood (so that the correlation between age and stage is about 0.40 among adolescents and around 0.04 among adults, across studies involving more than 12,000 people).`[^1]`{=markdown} As a result, a 1999 mixed sample of 4510 adults in the United States--including accountants and artists, priests and prisoners, in ages ranging from 18 to 82 (with ages 35 to 65 most represented)--shows a mode (peak) at Expert, with fewer adults at an earlier or later stage.`[^2]`{=markdown}

```{r Load-Data, echo=FALSE}
results_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Results.csv")
samples_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Samples.csv")
stages_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Name-Stages.csv")

results_df <- read.csv(results_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
samples_df <- read.csv(samples_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  filter(Author == "Cook-Greuter", Date == "2013") %>%
  mutate(Description = paste0("N=", .$Count, " ", .$Country, " ", .$Population))
stages_df <- read.csv(stages_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  filter(Researcher == "Joiner", Version == "Level of Agility", E > 1, E < 10)

joiner <- c("2" = "Enthusiast", "3" = "Operator", "4" = "Conformer", "5" = "Expert",
            "6" = "Achiever", "7" = "Catalyst", "8" = "Co-Creator", "9" = "Synergist")
wilber <- c("2" = "magenta", "3" = "red", "4" = "#FFBF00", "5" = "#FFBF00",
            "6" = "orange", "7" = "green", "8" = "#008080", "9" = "turquoise")
```

```{r Cook-Greuter-Mixed-Adults, echo=FALSE}
results_mixed <- results_df %>% filter(Sample == 1)
samples_mixed <- samples_df %>% filter(Sample == 1)

description <- paste(samples_mixed$Description, "(%)")

ggplot(results_mixed, aes(x = Rating, y = Percentage)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = joiner, limits = c(2,9), n.breaks = 9) +
  theme_tufte() +
  labs(title = description)
```

## Consultants

However, other samples show a different bell-like distribution of stages; for example, a sample of 535 managers and consultants in the UK had a mode at Achiever.`[^2]`{=markdown}

```{r Cook-Greuter-Results, echo=FALSE}
consultants <- results_df %>%
  filter(Sample < 4) %>%
  inner_join(samples_df, by = "Sample")
ggplot(consultants, aes(x = Rating, y = Percentage, shape=Description)) + geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(shape = "Sample", title = "Bell-like distribution of stages") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = joiner, limits = c(2,9), n.breaks = 9) +
  theme_tufte()
```

This comparison could prompt multiple questions for further research:

* Is the difference between samples significant?
* The inclination to find out about one's own personality make-up via testing rarely occurs before the Achiever stage, with Conformer and Expert stages not requesting feedback.`[^2]`{=markdown} Is the variation in samples due to self-selection?
* Development can occur when the interpersonal environment disconfirms expectations characteristic of a specific stage.`[^1]`{=markdown} Does this environment vary across national cultures?
* Prior to the Achiever stage, perspective- and role-taking experiences can facilitate development,`[^1]`{=markdown} and the Co-Creator stage enjoys a variety of roles.`[^3]`{=markdown} Does the variety of engagements in consulting work provide these perspective- and role-taking experiences?
* Post-conventional personalities--at the Catalyst, Co-Creator, and Synergist stages--don't often remain long in large corporations.`[^4]`{=markdown} Does this reduce the prevalence of these stages among managers and supervisors?

## Agile Consultants

Agile software development started with a manifesto from those who are "are uncovering better ways of developing software by... helping others do it."`[^5]`{=markdown} One of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is this:

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
> its behavior accordingly.

Agile practices involve the application of the scientific method to social management, through iterative cycles of identifying a problem, planning, acting, and evaluating empirical phenomena—the “Deming Wheel” of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).`[^6]`{=markdown} Consequently feedback is fundamental to Agile practice.

I selected a team of Agile consultants from a what an owner described as a "boutique Agile consultancy" (later acquired by a multinational consultancy). After approximately 50 minutes of an hour-long interview, I provided feedback (in [Perfection Game](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/perfection-game/) form) on the answers I had heard to my questions in the previous 50 minutes. I then observed how the feedback was integrated into the conversation.

This approach comes from a developmental perspective.`[^7]`{=markdown} It is inquiring whether the *espoused theory* of the value of feedback in Agile is part of the *theory-in-use* of the Agile consultant.`[^8]`{=markdown} They "talk the talk" but do they "walk the walk"?

```{r Feedback, echo=FALSE}
feedback_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Feedback.csv")
read.csv(feedback_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  filter(Researcher == "Cook-Greuter") %>%
  inner_join(stages_df, by = "E") %>%
  filter(E > 2, E < 10) %>%
  select(Name, Feedback) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Development and Feedback",
        col.names = c("Level", "The Concept of Feedback"), escape = TRUE, format = "html") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2:3, background = "#FFBF00") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "orange") %>%
  row_spec(5, background = "green") %>%
  row_spec(6, background = "#008080") %>%
  row_spec(7, background = "turquoise")
```

In 2017 I took the [Global Leadership Profile (GLP)](https://www.gla.global/the-glp-overview/), a `[sentence completion profile]({% post_url 2021-03-07-What-Is-Growing-Up %})`{=markdown}. In 2018 the 13 full-time members of the consultant team--a dozen Agile coaches and one Agile coordinator--took the GLP as well. I debriefed the GLP for each member of the consultant team after estimating the rating using descriptions from [The Seven Levels of Leadership Development and Their Impact](https://www.gla.global/the-glp/levels-of-leadership-development/). My estimate matched the profile rating within one-third stage the vast majority of the time.`[^9]`{=markdown}

```{r Descriptions, echo=FALSE}
description_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Description.csv")
read.csv(description_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  filter(Researcher == "Torbert") %>%
  inner_join(stages_df, by = "E") %>%
  filter(E > 2, E < 10) %>%
  select(Name, Description) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "The Seven Levels of Leadership",
        col.names = c("Level", "Description"), escape = TRUE, format = "html") %>%
  row_spec(1, background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(2:3, background = "#FFBF00") %>%
  row_spec(4, background = "orange") %>%
  row_spec(5, background = "green") %>%
  row_spec(6, background = "#008080") %>%
  row_spec(7, background = "turquoise")
```

The profile ratings were the following:

- 4 Achiever,
- 8 Catalyst, and
- 2 Co-Creator.

Note that this small sample has a later mode (Catalyst) than previous larger studies.

```{r Distribute-Profiles, echo=FALSE}
profile_path <- file.path(base_dir, "_data", "Source-GLP.csv")
profile_df <- read.csv(profile_path, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
team <- profile_df %>%
  select(Profile, ACN, Client, Rating, Modifier) %>%
  arrange(Rating, Modifier) %>%
  filter(ACN == TRUE, Client == TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Member = row_number())
ggplot(team, aes(x = Rating, fill = factor(Rating))) + geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", title = "Agile Consultant Profiles") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wilber) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:9, labels = joiner, limits = c(2,10)) +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Conclusion

My intent in interviewing, selecting, profiling, and providing feedback to Agile consultants was a transforming team, not rigorous statistical results. Nevertheless the results suggest that the following may, indeed, encourage growth:

* perspective- and role-taking experiences, such as those provided by consulting engagements;
* a community that values feedback, like the Agile movement; and
* accepting, welcoming, or even inviting direct personal feedback on a team.
