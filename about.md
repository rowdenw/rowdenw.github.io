During the workday I coach and consult to enterprise transformation leaders, fostering teams, and mentoring and developing coaches. I am certified to debrief the [Leadership Circle Profile](https://leadershipcircle.com/en/products/leadership-circle-profile/), and am an [advanced practitioner](https://www.gla.global/about/certified-global-leadership-coaches/certified-coaches-in-the-us-and-canada/) of the [Global Leadership Profile](https://www.gla.global/the-glp-overview/).

In mornings and evenings I am a mindfulness practitioner. I am also a lifelong learner, learning about language, people, and philosophy; and reading about economics, mysticism, religion, and spirituality.

On the weekends I like to reflect and write about the past and the future. On leave I travel across cultures--especially Spanish-speaking countries like Spain--appreciating architecture (for example, Alhambra, Chichén Itzá, and the Taj Mahal), forests, landscapes, parks, wildlife, etc.
