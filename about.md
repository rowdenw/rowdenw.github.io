> [He] had true insight into your nature when he said that you were a philosopher, for wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder....

~ Plato[^1]

## William

Through me, the universe wonders at itself (and watches itself wondering), until my great disappearance.

During the workday I coach and consult to enterprise transformation leaders, fostering teams, and mentoring and developing coaches. I am certified to debrief the [Leadership Circle Profile](https://leadershipcircle.com/en/products/leadership-circle-profile/), an [advanced practitioner](https://www.gla.global/about/certified-global-leadership-coaches/certified-coaches-in-the-us-and-canada/) of the [Global Leadership Profile](https://www.gla.global/the-glp-overview/), and [trained to facilitate Immunity to Change workshops](https://mindsatwork.com/programs-services/coach-development/facilitators-workshop/). More details are in my [online CV]({% link cv.html %}).

In mornings and evenings I am a mindfulness practitioner. I am also a lifelong learner, learning about language, people, and philosophy; and reading about economics, mysticism, religion, and spirituality.

On the weekends I like to reflect and write about the past and the future. On leave I travel across cultures--especially Spanish-speaking countries like Spain--appreciating architecture (for example, Alhambra, Chichén Itzá, and the Taj Mahal), forests, landscapes, parks, wildlife, etc.

## Global Leadership Profile

Those with whom I have debriefed the Global Leadership profile have provided this feedback:

> I liked you asking for ideas and you following them. I liked the open questions, and the flow of conversation.

> * Intent and trust make a difference.
> * Natural conversation works.
> * It was powerful to see the responses and contrast them.
> * The graph was nice.

> * I liked being asked what I want to get out of this.
> * Good coaching questions (but not a barrage) early on helped lead to thoughtfulness.
> * I lost track of time.

> * I appreciated you asking what I want, being congnizant of theory and practice.
> * I felt you really connected with who I am and what I was saying.
> * It was a good prompt, and the follow-up created significance.

> * I like that you tuned into my frustration.
> * Visuals helped, along with the history, and examples.

> [We] are touched that you take a personal interest.

> I really liked the questions [in advance] so I could make notes about what I wanted to say.

> You saw more from my sentences than I expected. It's a bit like talking to a psychiatrist or hairdresser. That's helpful. I've saturated myself with personal development material over the years. This is different. It's quite meaty.

> We got to a thread that feels real.

> I like the requirement to think about my goals and impact--and how to get there.
