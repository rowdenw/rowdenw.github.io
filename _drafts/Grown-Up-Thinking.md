> The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.

~ Gregory Bateson[^a]

Major problems in the world--[nuclear war](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/), [climate change](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/), [pandemics](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/), [artificial intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/), biotechnology, etc.--means that we have a nonzero [probability of self-annihilation]({% post_url 2021-01-26-Estimate-Galactic-ETI %}). How can we learn to think in ways that better understand foreign relations between nuclear powers, climatic systems, ecosystems, intelligent decision-making systems, etc.? Herb Koplowitz notes:

> Barry Commoner (quoted in M. Bateson, 1972) and G. Bateson (1972) refer to the inability of adults, scientists, and laymen alike to understand cyclical, patterned phenomena such as interpersonal relationships and a variety of biological processes because they attempt to understand cause-and-effect patterns as linear.[^b]

Koplowitz sees three groups of stages in adult cognitive development: pre-logical, logical, and post-logical.[^c] Into these groups I'll place stages of [development]({% post_url 2021-03-07-What-Is-Growing-Up %}) (using [Bill Joiner](https://changewise.biz/?page_id=249&..)'s names and [Bill Torbert](http://www.williamrtorbert.com/about-bill-torbert/bill-torbert/)'s groups).

## Pre-Logical, Pre-Conventional Thinking

### Explorer and Ethusiast

Pre-logical and pre-conventional thinking is from birth to preteen or (United States) grade school years: Explorer, Enthusiast, and Operator. During the Explorer stage a child develops "object permanence" in what Piaget called the sensorimotor stage, as shown in a [video on Piaget's Stages of Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRF27F2bn-A). During the Ethusiast stage...[^d]

### Operator

## Pre-Logical, Conventional Thinking

### Conformer

### Expert

## Logical Thinking: Achiever



## Post-Logical, Post-Conventional Thinking

### Catalyst

### Co-Creator

### Synergist
