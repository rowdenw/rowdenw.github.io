intro,"William Rowden was the consultant enterprise transformation leader for the three-year Agile initiatives at an American multinational corporation and at an American telecommunications company. In between he worked with several executive teams to roadmap their Agile journey after assessing their organizations. For scaling, he has provided both LeSS and SAFe coaching.

William uses a four-factor approach to leading Agile transformations: 1) sponsor and lead consultant pairing and profiling; 2) adapting frameworks, goals, and teaching to organizational culture and structure; 3) executive steering; and 4) a coaching team. This approach is based upon a synthesis of research on—and experience with—adult development, organizational development, and leadership."

I have worked with advertisers, financial services companies, an integrated managed care consortium, a medical device manufacturer, a retail store, a social media service, software development companies, and telecommunication companies, collaborating to adapt workflow and technical practices to their needs. Having co-founded the Agile software company that inspired Personal Kanban has enabled me to understand all aspects of running an Agile/Lean organization."
